# zk-engine
Zk engine is the continuation of the work done at Torus, where we wanted to build a privacy based network that allowed programmability.
The first step is the transformation of Nightfall from an optimistic to a Zk rollup, which would constitute a platform for the private exchange
of tokens. Nightall supports private minting, transfers and swaps of tokens (previously minted) between parties.
I plan to add additional applications, such as identity, to enable use cases where one can combine both functions (transactions and identity) to prove programmability.
